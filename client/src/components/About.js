				We like craft breweries and we particularly like those which allow dogs,
				are open during the day, and have WiFi so we can code away with our
				best buddies. While there are other websites and resources available,
				none had an easy-to-use, publically-accessible API. The goal of this
				project is to keep an up-to-date, curated, and publically available
				database of breweries for the betterment of the beer community and joy
				of web developers like us.
